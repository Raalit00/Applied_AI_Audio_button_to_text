            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a project to develop an e-commerce website for a
              client. The website was tailored to the client's needs and
              included features such as a product database, shopping cart, and
              order management.

          <li>
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a project to develop an event website for a local
              organization. The website included information about upcoming
              events, a way to register online, and a discussion forum for
              participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a project to redesign the website of a restaurant. The
              website included information about the menu, opening hours, and a
              way to make reservations online.
